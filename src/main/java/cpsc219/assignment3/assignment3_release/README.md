List of things done:
1)Ensured that Guess.getLetterStatus() appropriately encapsulates data. You may use this method in other parts of the project if necessary
No changes are needed in State.java specifically for the purpose of ensuring data encapsulation in Guess.getLetterStatus(). The encapsulation is handled entirely within the Guess class.
