List of things done:
1)Ensured that Guess.getLetterStatus() appropriately encapsulates data. You may use this method in other parts of the project if necessary
No changes are needed in State.java specifically for the purpose of ensuring data encapsulation in Guess.getLetterStatus(). The encapsulation is handled entirely within the Guess class.
2)Changed color of guess button in scene builder
3)did testing in gamerunner
4)populated wordgrid to give player some sense of whats happening
5)Ensured that the constructor uses data structures which are well-encapsulated. Ensure
   that other objects using data structures created by the constructor are using a deep copy of these
   data structures.
